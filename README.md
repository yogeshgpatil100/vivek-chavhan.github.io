## &#10023; Academic Projects
* **DEGREE MEGA PROJECT TITLE: Design and Fabrication of Electric Moped**
> * SUMMERY: To check the different conditions of buckling under different end condition of specimen as per load. 
> * Description:
>   * This Project aim at an investigation of buckling behavior of columns under repetitive compressive loading. Buckling occurs when column has a tendency to deflect laterally, our of the line of action of the force. Once buckling initiates, the instability can lead to failure of the column, because the eccentric force acts as a moment causing greater stresses and deflections due to the combination of the bending and axial forces.
>   * All parts subjected to pressure are susceptible to buckling. Thus, buckling test device has a great number of potential applications. The device can be used both by the instructor for demonstrations as well as by the trainee in laboratory experiments. Furthermore, basic technical testing skills such as deflection, slope and force measurement can be practiced.
>   * In this project, a test specimen is clamped at both ends in the experimental setup, depending on the buckling case. A height-adjustable loading member and a hand-operated spindle are used to apply a compressive force on the test specimen. A angle measurement sensor(accelerometer) indicates the angle(Slope) through which the test specimen get deflected from its initial position.
>   * Experiments demonstrate how various factors such as test specimen length, material and end support conditions affect the buckling behavior. Additional shear forces can be generated on the test bar by means of a lalteral load mechanism.

* **DEGREE MINI PROJECT TITLE: DesignandF fabrication of gearless transmission *
> * SUMMERY: To reduce the efforts require for pumping the water & drawing more water through hand pump.
> * Description:
>   * The main aim of our project was to design a hand pump which is employed with quick return mechanism.
>   * The major problems associated with the simple hand pump were the high level of fatigue of the operator, and low pump capacity. These Problems motivated the design and fabrication of a manually operated hand pump that employs a quick-return mechanism and a gear drive in the power train to capacity. The system designed is basically a modification to reciprocating lift pumps. The modified pump is operated by the rotary movement of the handle with a quick return mechanism. Typical hand pumps require sufficiently large effort and an average person can use the pump continuously only for a short time, but the modified hand pump with which we tried to come up requries only minimum of the efforts, with minimal fatigue. The advantage of this invention compared to present hand pump solutions are: more water can be drawn manually with less efforts as compared to simple hand pump, for irrigation purpose bulls could also be employed to rotate the rotor by particular arrangement.
